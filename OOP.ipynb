In this case all the methods, including __init__, have the first parameter as self.We know that class is a blueprint for the objects. This blueprint can be used to create multiple numbers of objects. Let's create two different objects from the above class. The self keyword is used to represent an instance (object) of the given class. In this case, the two Cat objects cat1 and cat2 have their own name and age attributes. If there was no self argument, the same class couldn't hold the information for both these objects.\n",
